# Hi, I'm Hannan 👋

Robotics & Electronics Engineer | Research Assistant  
Karachi, Pakistan

I work on autonomous robotic systems with a strong focus on control, simulation, and system integration. My work spans mobile robots, robotic manipulators, and sensor-based systems using **ROS/ROS 2**, **Gazebo**, and **MoveIt**.

Alongside simulation and software, I have extensive hands-on experience in **digital fabrication and rapid prototyping**. I design mechanical components in **Blender**, manufacture prototypes using **3D printing (Ultimaker S5)**, and work with **CNC machining**, **laser cutting**, and **PCB prototyping** to translate simulations into real hardware.

Some of my ongoing work involves **space-robotics-related simulation and control projects** under confidentiality constraints. I am particularly interested in robotics, control systems, cyber-physical systems, and space applications.
